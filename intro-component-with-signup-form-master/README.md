## Overview

### About the Project

Practice building out a sign-up form complete with client-side validation using JavaScript. Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM Manipulation

**Note: I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.**


## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to anyone providing feedback on my solution. It definitely helps to find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
