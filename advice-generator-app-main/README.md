## Overview

### About the Project

The perfect project if you're learning how to interact with 3rd-party APIs. This challenge uses the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice. The main challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (Fetch Api & Asynchronous & Promises & Modules)

**Note: I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.**

### What I Learned

my first Challenge I deal with API, and I've also used Modules to separate JS files. I didn't spend much effort on design as the main goal here was to practice JavaScript.
