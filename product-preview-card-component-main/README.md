## Overview

### About the Project

 The main challenge is to build out  this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS/SASS
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.**

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to anyone providing feedback on my solution. It helps to find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
