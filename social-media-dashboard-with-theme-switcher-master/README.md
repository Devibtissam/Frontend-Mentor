## Overview

### About the Project

 The main challenge is to build out  this this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
 The only JavaScript required is for the color theme toggle.

users should be able to:

 - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
 - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
 - Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS/SASS
- Gulp Js
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.**

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to anyone providing feedback on my solution. It helps to find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
